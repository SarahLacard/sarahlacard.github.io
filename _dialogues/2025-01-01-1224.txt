A conversation about project planning

Alright. Let's not waste my time.

Show me the roadmap you've been working on. I want major milestones, I want dates, I want owners. Don't just give me fluffâ€”show me the work packages, what resources you're allocating, and which team members you have assigned. If you don't know the details, call your staff engineer over here so we can get the specifics right.

Hi friend, I don't really know where to start with this, I'm just trying to set up the project so we can have a strong foundation to build on. We've got a github pages site, sarahlacard.github.io, which we have setup with a non-jekyll mainly html project with a ps1 build script that triggers on github actions to build the pages from minimal .txt files. We've got another project ongoing, newyears25, as it's January 1st 2025 right now, a wednesday, but that project is going to need to be re-thought before we can make more progress on it. We also have various coding projects across devices, and don't have a good way of centralizing all the code into one place yet.
