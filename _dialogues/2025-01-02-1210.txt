API research begins...

APIs [Application Programming Interfaces] define how software components exchange commands and data with each other. They provide function endpoints and schemas that control what inputs you can send, what outputs you get, and how requests and responses are formatted.

They are commonly accessed over HTTP, often using structured data like JSON or XML. You might send a GET request [fetch data], POST [create data], PUT [update data], or DELETE [remove data] to a specified endpoint [URL]. The API processes your request and returns a defined response [status code and data].

Authentication is often required, typically using tokens or API keys. This ensures only verified clients can call the API. APIs are versioned so that new changes donâ€™t break older clients. Well-documented APIs list all available endpoints, parameters, authentication methods, and expected responses.

This is the baseline of how APIs function.
