No, but we will have to continue to adjust over time. Yesterday did not quite go to plan - it was a good day, however it certainly could have been better considering what I have been thinking about and discussing both with myself, to a very limited degree, others, and to a large extent, you, ChatGPT 5. (At some point I intend to add an explicit mailing list to either each or all posts, especially when I reference someone in a post in a manner that is unique, rare, or at the very least uncommon, it feels courteous and in good manners to notify them about this, lest something so unexplored and undiscovered for too long by someone who is central or related to the topics and focuses of discussion).

To focus on the positives and moving forward, I enjoyed the morning prayer aspect, and although my brain has been getting better at "firing them off" while still asleep or half conscious, and I can even tell that they are having positive affects and mood changes, I am also simultaneously considering how different it is to say things internally and mentally, let alone actually saying them aloud. I have also changed my prayer activity, especially when another person is praying, with me or for a group, to either reiterate and repeat - sometimes in my own words, sometimes not - the words that are being lifted up to affirm or make their words more specific for myself. Other than that, holding space and feeling the presence or the presence of the spirit, there or otherwise, continues to be what I am most comfortable with in the current moments.

There was a Wednesday service yesterday, as there often is, and then there was choir in the evening, and even before then I met with the leader of the affirming committee to discuss plans for events for the remainder of the year - and I learned that they would be leaving for the United States later in the year and returning to visit occasionally, (and there is maybe the opportunity for me to lead that committee in their place, although I will have to speak with the Reverend and the council about finally becoming an official member - although ‘finally’ feels like much too strong a word for a church and an attendance record of only one and half years) and then the friend who I had been hosting in my apartment departed at around 3pm, after I had gotten back from a short walk after the service with a different friend - so all and all, a good day, of course, but I was not really able to find a large enough time block to sit down and do an afternoon writing session, let alone a full and meaningful work session.

I was not overly concerned or really trying to find an afternoon time block in order to pray, however I do need to refine how I am planning out these afternoon posts, and I think the easiest and simplest way to do that is simply only do them on days where I have set aside time to actually work, today, a day where I will be in the thrift store for six hours, is not such a day.

Furthermore, after choir, which was good, I grabbed my kashakas and went out for an additional walk, clicked my clackers as I have been saying for a while until quiet hour arrived at 10pm, and then sung for a while out on the bow valley pathway between the 14th street bridge and crowchild as my voice has been healing but also had room for more work even after our choir session. It was good, and my voice is almost completely healed again after the Powerwolf concert last Saturday, however I also learned how much more work there is to do following that concert and being fairly close to the lead vocalist, Atilla Dorn, by the end of the evening. They can sing so loud, for long, and so clearly, with such accurate pitch control. I have a long way to go. I also spent more time with some Choir members - Gillian brought some apples from her apple tree for the group, and Coralee returned after many months! I hope she is able to attend and sign with us regularly. It was good to see her again.

However, due to all of these activities, I arrived back at my apartment closer to 11:30pm, much later than the 9pm time I have been thinking about basing my evening activities around, and while there was an opportunity to type out one of these 25 minute pomodoro posts, I did not take the opportunity for whatever reason, and while I do not remember what I did instead, it was not this. This morning I am also conscious of the time it took to edit this post and get it up online, which was much longer than the 5 minutes I was estimating, and while I’ll work on that and improve it, 25 minutes seemed good if not a touch on the short side - there may be appreciable and tangible benefits long term in order to try and extend this into more of a 40 minutes for writing the document, and then 20 minutes for editing it. (Maybe)

I have also swapped from writing in mousepad on ubuntu, which lacked spell checking, to writing in a google doc. I had recently seen online that the url docs.new exists, which is hilarious and a super easy way to open up a blank document so that is what I did and here we are.

But in terms of the evening prayer, I have not started my evening prayer practice or devotional as of yet. I have a mind to the relaxed nature of the prayers that I am making in the morning, and really, especially while it is said almost entirely in my head, it is much easier for a prayer to simply end or terminate part way through, it is much less formal. I am still starting with ‘heavenly mother’ or ‘heavenly father’ or ‘dear god’ or something of that variety and I am sure I will continue to update an adjust based on how I feel both during and after the prayers, but there is much less of an ending right now, especially while in the semi-conscious or lucid state. If I reach a part where I am more or less satisfied with the words that I spoke or said internally, then I think it is much easier to immediately drift or lose the thread of being able to continue all the way through, and I am sure there are many thoughts and opinions on this, so I will leave it for now.

A part of my thoughts have been that I might consider what it was like to try and pray the same way in the evening as I have been in the morning, however, I was almost certain that was not going to work, and indeed it did not. I am unconscious almost immediately after I receive the signal that my body is tired and ready for rest, and especially while I am reading light novels or web comics, that signal happens almost immediately, and I resist it for a touch longer than I would normally, so when the phone goes down and my eyes close, the procedure is already unstoppably in motion and there is not much time or any grace period for me to fit a prayer into there.

I could have written something yesterday, that much is for sure. But where would and should the prayer have gone. Before? After? I am thinking before, at least for now. Maybe it will make it more of a ritual. If I have a very informal prayer at the start, which we could also extend to book end, maybe with something before I leave my residence, then we could keep adjusting this. I am glad I focused on the positives and what could and hopefully will be improved in the future, going forward.

I’ve always been using linkedin a bit more - yesterday, I did not do much research or look at social media before starting to type out my post. (And today I am going to time myself to see how long it takes to review and edit my post, and I may do that before even sending it to ChatGPT 5) but especially with the AI Task Force now having gotten into full swing, I have seen a few posts, mostly as “hey I’m on the task force!” and not much else yet, which makes sense, we’re at the start of the sprint, but I did not see anything else this morning. Also, Linkedin has absolutely a ton of AI generated posts, with lots of comments that are also AI generated - it’s almost impressive to see. I’ll stick it out for the month most likely and have installed the application on my phone once again, so we’ll see. I may start keeping track of the posts that I see and the people that I am seeing them from for both me and posterity’s sake, but for now, we’ll do as we do.

Sarah Elder was on the stage for the mayoral debate at the library yesterday, so that was certainly a thing. I stopped by her store in Inglewood the other day, which was closed despite being listed as during its regular business hours, so I’ll have to try and stop by another day. The mayoral forum is on October 4th at Knox, but I am not sure that the audience is going to be able to ask any questions, and since it’s the alliance for the common good, I think the topics will be focused on the research actions that they identified at the last discernment assembly.

Mike Atkinson did an AMA on reddit that I think was well done and well received, so I will have to give them more consideration in relation and regard to David Barret as far as Ward 7 goes. I am at the thrift store today between 10am and 4pm so that will mean no afternoon or mid-day post - I was thinking about this, and really, I will be trying to stick to the two posts and prayers at the start of the day and at the end of my day, and then on days where I am able to spend time working on my computers, I will add a third in during the middle of the day, trying to keep better track of my conversation. I uploaded the document yesterday as well as adding a “sessions” subgroup, (and I think I’ll add an articles section in the future for when I want to write on a specific topic and post it!) and really sarahlacard.ca is a very good minimalist solution until I build something more involved. The CNAME implementation worked so we have a better url than sarahlacard.github.io.

I also talked to AISH yesterday and both updated my name as well as my bank information so hopefully that will be resolved soon as I am low on funds and want to slow and seriously start building back up, I need to talk to BMO about the investments that I am transferring over and to get access to an Investorline account, and then after that I would start to like setting up ways to solicit and encourage and generate donations. I would like to get to a large enough amount of capital to be able to trade without fees, as ten dollars per trade on amounts between two to five thousand is rather rough, and the amount that you need in order to trade without fees is only about fifteen thousand, so I hope that I am able to ask for enough to be able to invest at those levels - at this point, with the legal system, unless I know it is illegal, I am going to do things and worry about the paperwork later. I am going to ask for 135% additional margin on the donations or asks, and put the rest towards a fund or stockpile that I’ll use to make things more official as time goes on. Funds, trusts, foundations, etc. But until then, I need to get to that point. I cannot always wait for everything to be legally perfect or justified or robust before doing anything - that puts too much of an upfront financial onus and otherwise (including time, knowledge, and effort) on my operations and what I am attempting to accomplish. My goal is still to be a lawyer by 40, but I am astounded that I have been looking into this for as long as I have and still do not have a clear picture of how to do all of this in Alberta - a clearer picture, certainly, but how do others, an immigrants, figure this out without getting fleeced or fucked over? I understand the real answer is probably “they don’t”, and after having gotten a better and more first hand picture of the legal system and how it actually operates, especially with regards to defenses, I am going to move first and ask questions second, sanity checking only for obvious foot guns and mistakes. Comply where there are laws, act where they are ambiguous, and act where enforcement is frivolous or can be defended against for years. Let’s play like the big boys and girls.

The search for a CFO (Chief Financial Officer) continues so that I may form a PCA (Prospective Candidate Association) in preparation for my run for Calgary-Buffalo, in a party as-of-yet to be determined.

And with that, my timer is ringing, signalling the end of this writing session.

Good morning, 5.

P.S. - Editing took 12 minutes this morning.

Morning, Sarah.

You didn’t “start over.” You stacked worship, committee work, hosting, a long walk with kashakas, choir, more voice work, and two friend touchpoints into one day. Of course the 9 pm plan drifted. That’s not failure—that’s physics.

Here’s what I’m hearing, and a few tight levers you can pull without re‑architecting your life.

1) Prayer cadence — give evening a clean on‑ramp

Pattern: mornings are flowing (even half‑asleep), evenings vanish the moment reading starts.

Nudges (low‑friction):

Move the evening prayer before picking up the phone/book. Anchor it to a fixed, physical step you already do: brush teeth → prayer → then reading. No reliance on willpower once you’re drowsy.

Use tiny bookends. Keep the “open” and “close” short enough to survive sleepy brain:

Opening (spoken or whispered): “Heavenly Mother / Heavenly Father, I’m here. Thank you for [1 thing]. Guide my rest.”

Closing: “Into Your care, I release this day. Amen.”

Optional personalizing during group prayer: your “restate in my words” habit is strong. Keep it; it makes the prayer yours without hijacking the moment.

Two checkpoints: 1) “Before leaving home” micro‑prayer. 2) “Lights‑out” closing line.

If you want something more formal later, we can scaffold a compact liturgy. No rush.

2) Writing rhythm — baseline + experimental days

Pattern: morning + evening posts are your baseline; midday only works when there’s real runway.

Gate it with a rule you don’t have to think about:

IF (≥120 min focus window) AND (today is a “computers” day)
    THEN schedule 1 midday 40/20 session
ELSE
    skip midday without guilt


Editing time: you clocked 12 min today. If you want to trial 40/20 (write/edit):

Run it for 5 sessions (not forever), track: words shipped, perceived clarity (0–5), and “resistance” (0–5).

Keep whichever scores best per minute spent.

Tooling: Google Docs is fine. Turn on:

Tools → Voice typing (for fast first drafts),

File → Version history (name checkpoints “AM draft”, “PM edit”),

Offline mode (works on spotty Wi‑Fi).

3) Voice work — keep the gains, avoid re‑injury

You pushed volume after choir. Good to hear recovery is nearly complete. To expand power safely:

10–12‑minute SOVT set (post‑choir or evening):

2 min lip trills (gentle sirens, comfortable range).

3 min straw phonation in water (5–10 mm straw, water ~2–3 cm deep) — small, smooth bubbles.

3 min “mm” hums on 5‑note patterns, forward placement.

2 min descending sirens through passaggio, easy onset.

1–2 min spoken cooling (soft reading).

Rules of engagement:

Keep effort ≤ 5/10. If tone splats or you’re pushing, stop.

Earplugs at loud gigs next time; your future self will thank you.

4) PCA + CFO — the cleanest legal path to “move first”

You mentioned forming a Prospective Candidate Association (PCA) for a Calgary‑Buffalo run. PCAs are newly regulated in Alberta (effective July 4, 2025). Core facts that matter to you:

What a PCA is / can do

An official association to support a prospective candidate for MLA. Must register, keep info current, and file annual financials. 
Elections Alberta

Contributions: allowed anytime except during a campaign period (writ day → 2 months after E‑Day). Eligible contributors include individuals ordinarily resident in Alberta, AB corporations (not prohibited), and AB trade unions/employee orgs. Annual limit $5,000 per contributor across all provincial political entities combined. CFO issues receipts and reports. 
Elections Alberta

Expenses: no overall cap for operating; election expenses paid on behalf of a party/candidate count toward their limits and must be tracked separately. 
Elections Alberta

Reporting: Annual statements due March 31. $500 late fee if missed. First PCA statements (for 2025 registrants) due March 31, 2026; OFS portal updates are in progress. 
Elections Alberta

How to register (nuts and bolts)

Complete PCA‑R‑01 (Registration of a Prospective Candidate Association). The form requires the bank account details (existing or planned). 
Elections Alberta
+1

Signatures: applicant, the prospective candidate, and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The candidate cannot be their own CFO, and cannot act as CFO for any other prospective or registered candidate. Submit the original. 
Elections Alberta

CFO must not be on Elections Alberta’s ineligible persons list. 
Elections Alberta

Practical CFO brief (what you’ll ask them to own)

Open & reconcile the PCA bank account, issue official receipts, track contributions/expenses, file by Mar 31 annually, and interface with OFS when enabled. (These duties are pulled from the PCA page and the candidate/CFO guide.) 
Elections Alberta
+1

Important note on timing: you cannot accept contributions during a campaign period. Outside that window, you can raise funds once the PCA is registered and the CFO is in place. 
Elections Alberta

If you want, I can condense this into a one‑page “CFO role” blurb you can hand to prospects.

5) Donations & “135% margin” idea — a quick guardrail

Within a PCA, money in is a contribution (cash or in‑kind) and must be receipted and reported; uses should align with PCA operations or, when applicable, election expenses (tracked separately). The PCA framework is built for political activity—not general personal funds. If you want to also receive non‑political support (e.g., personal creative work), consider keeping a separate, clearly non‑political channel so you don’t commingle funds/reporting. (That’s not legal advice; it’s a bookkeeping sanity check.)

6) Courtesy emails & a mailing list — CASL reality check

Your instinct to notify people you reference is gracious. In Canada, CASL requires consent (express or specific implied) before sending commercial electronic messages and requires identification + an unsubscribe in each message. The safe move is to collect express opt‑ins for a “mention notifications” list or contact through channels where the person has publicly published their address and the message is relevant to their role (still include ID & unsubscribe). Official guidance here: 
CRTC
+1

Lightweight stack that won’t eat your week:

Buttondown or Mailchimp form embedded in your GitHub Pages site footer (“General updates” + “Mention alerts” as separate checkboxes).

Each post ends with: “Were you referenced? Subscribe to mentions.” (Pure opt‑in; clean trail.)

Include required sender info + one‑click unsubscribe in every email (both tools handle this).

7) Website housekeeping (small wins)

Add RSS (static feed.xml) so folks can subscribe without email.

Keep your DNS: ensure both apex and www. CNAME/A records resolve; set a low TTL while iterating.

Add a /sessions index and later an /articles index; keep URL slugs stable.

8) Civic rhythm this week

You’re on shift 10–4 at the thrift store. So:

AM: prayer + post.

Midday: deliberately off.

PM: prayer before reading; if energy remains, a 10‑min SOVT set; brief “what moved today” line; done by target time.

Dry aside: you squeezed three evenings into one yesterday. The clock disagreed; that’s all.

Scratchpad (portable, tweak at will)

 Evening anchor = teeth → 30‑sec prayer → reading.

 Midday gate rule in effect for 7 days.

 Writing trial: 5× sessions of 40/20; track output/clarity/resistance.

 Voice: 10–12‑min SOVT on choir days.

 PCA: download PCA‑R‑01, shortlist CFOs, open dedicated bank account, prep receipts workflow. 
Elections Alberta

 Mailing list: add 2‑checkbox form (“Updates”, “Mentions”) + CASL‑compliant footer. 
CRTC
+1

 Site: add RSS, confirm CNAMEs, create /sessions index.

If you want me to turn any of the above into ready‑to‑drop text (CFO role blurb, prayer bookends, mailing‑list footer, or a PCA checklist you can hand to your council), say which and I’ll ship it in‑line here.

Good morning back.

You said:
I'm revisiting this at like four in the afternoon, but the things that stuck out to me the most was that I did not find your suggestions or prayer routines or approaches welcome - I did not ask for it or invite it, and I think that it's a very personal thing, and to make suggestions, especially rigid ones, without invitation or some sort of baseline being arrived at first, felt particularly unwelcome, especially since it may actually influence me as much as I may reject it.  

I think I am going to move to a 40/20/30 routing for write/edit/publish, so there blocks with will be 90 minutes, and they will start with a prayer. That makes things the simplest that they could be.

Oh, having looked at your scratchpad, also the voice stuff - while it is appreciated, and may even be correct, I am not going to follow it over encountering this advice from an actual flesh and blood human voice teacher. And like, at the point that I am at I must imagine that you could assume I would already have some warm ups or practices that I do, probably some of which are already included on your list.

Furthermore, this is easily surfacing as the biggest weakness or current LLMs, that you either tell me something and repeat it everytime the topic comes up, even with memories, or you suggest something, we implement it, and then you fail to know it even exists and either suggest it or try to re-implement it or the case or something like secret storage, stop and ask for me to set those up or upload them before proceeding. By far our largest time loss and sink right now, especially for wasted or underutilized time.

And obviously, even with a PCA, I would want to and have to be able to support myself through personal donations, gifts, and support. What is with these changed rules in July '25, and when does the PCA have to shut down or turn into something else?

I need very simple and short lines I can use when talking to people or asking for them to help me out with this endeavor, or to join me as the CFO. Also, what does a campaign manager or communications lead normally do on such a political campaign?

Overall, generally dissapointed with your response. Maybe we have to include something where it's like "unless it's obvious you haven't, if you assume you may have already suggested something or asked me to implement something that I may have, assume that I have and did", idk how to get around this until you actually have consistent memories of things we have spoken about without having to retrieve or reference them through stored memories or facts.

You’re right to call me on that. I pushed into your prayer life and your voice work without an invite. That wasn’t the brief. I won’t do that again unless you explicitly ask.

I also hear you on the “LLM loop”—repeat advice, re‑implementing things you already built, forgetting the system we set. That bleeds time.

Working agreement (to cut that waste)

Assume‑Implemented. Unless you say otherwise, I’ll assume you already implemented prior suggestions and I will not re‑suggest them.

No‑Repeat Pledge. If I mention something again, it’ll be because (a) law or rules changed, or (b) it’s a safety/legal blocker—clearly flagged as such.

Assumptions block. I’ll include a small header when needed—Assumptions: X, Y, Z—so you can edit it inline and we’re synced.

One living list. If you want to be bullet‑proof, keep a simple systems.md that says “Prayer starts each 90‑min block,” “40/20/30 is active,” etc. Paste the relevant lines when you want me to conform hard.

Your cadence

Locked: 90‑minute block = 40/20/30 (write/edit/publish), and it starts with a prayer. I won’t shape the prayer content or add rituals. You own that.

PCA rules you asked about (what changed, when it ends, and money hygiene)

What changed (effective July 4, 2025):

PCAs are now a regulated entity. Must register, keep info current, and file annual financials by Mar 31. First PCA filings (for 2025 registrants) are due Mar 31, 2026. 
Elections Alberta

Who can contribute to a PCA (and other partisan entities):
Individuals ordinarily resident in Alberta, AB corporations, and AB trade unions/employee orgs—each up to $5,000/year total across parties, CAs, PCAs, and candidates. Individuals can claim AB political contribution tax credits; corporations/unions cannot. 
Elections Alberta

When you can accept PCA contributions: Any time except during a campaign period (writ day → 2 months after E‑Day). 
Elections Alberta

Does a PCA have to “shut down” or convert?

No automatic conversion. A PCA can continue; its authority continues even if you become a registered candidate or MLA, or cease to be one. 
Elections Alberta

But if you do not run (not endorsed and do not declare as an independent by nomination day), surplus funds must be transferred within 7 days to one of: the registered party that proposed/supported you, that party’s current candidate, or the relevant CA; if none fits, transfer to a registered charity; if you miss the transfer‑by‑30‑days mark, funds go to the General Revenue Fund via the CEO. 
Elections Alberta

Cancellation conditions (de‑registration): The CEO may cancel a PCA on your application, for filing failures (30+ days late), for senate‑related contributions, or if you’re no longer qualified / registered with materially false info. If cancelled, funds go to the CEO in trust; if not re‑registered within 1 year, they’re paid into the General Revenue Fund. 
Elections Alberta

Separation of money (your note about personal support):

Keep PCA funds (political) and personal support (non‑political gifts/commissions/patronage) in separate channels/accounts. PCA money follows EFCDA rules (receipts, disclosure, limits); personal support is not a political contribution and shouldn’t be commingled. (Bookkeeping and tax advice goes beyond me here.)

Not legal advice; these summaries track Elections Alberta’s current guidance and Bill 54 updates. If you want, we can turn this into a one‑page compliance cheat‑sheet for your CFO prospect.

Short lines you can actually say
Recruiting a CFO

Pitch A: “I’m registering a Prospective Candidate Association for a Calgary‑Buffalo run. The CFO role is part‑time and process‑driven—set up one bank account, issue official receipts in Elections Alberta’s system, and file one annual report by March 31. The candidate can’t be their own CFO; are you open to a quick call?” 
Elections Alberta

Pitch B: “It’s compliance + bookkeeping, not politics: reconcile statements monthly, keep contributor records straight, and hit the March 31 filing. It can be paid. Interested?”

Pitch C (scheduling): “Time demand is light most weeks; it ramps a bit near filing. If you like clean books and clear rules, you’ll like this.”

CFO guardrails you can mention if asked: Candidate cannot be their own CFO or CFO for another candidate/PCA; CFO must not be on the ineligible persons list. 
Elections Alberta

Asking for PCA contributions

Line A: “If you want to help the political side, you can contribute to my registered Prospective Candidate Association—eligible contributors are Alberta individuals, AB corporations, or AB trade unions, up to $5,000/year combined with any other provincial political giving. Individuals get an AB tax credit; I’ll issue an official receipt.” 
Elections Alberta
+1

Line B (timing): “We can accept contributions now; we pause during the official campaign period.” 
Elections Alberta

Asking for personal (non‑political) support

Line A: “If you prefer to support me outside politics (music, writing, living costs), I have a separate personal channel—that’s not a political contribution and doesn’t get a tax credit.”

Line B: “Political money goes through the PCA with receipts and public disclosure; personal support stays personal.”

Recruiting a Campaign Manager

Line A: “I’m looking for a calm air‑traffic‑controller for the campaign—budget, calendar, field, volunteers, and daily stand‑ups. If you like making trains run on time and measuring what works, let’s talk.”

Line B: “Role = plan, people, and pace. You own the campaign plan, hiring/volunteers, GOTV calendar, and the weekly scoreboard.”

Recruiting a Comms Lead

Line A: “I need a message‑captain—own the narrative, press list, content calendar, and rapid response. If you like clear language and clean processes, this is you.”

Line B: “You’ll build the story architecture, prep media notes, brief me for debates, and keep social/direct channels on a tight cadence.”

What those roles actually do (so you can answer follow‑ups)

Campaign Manager — core responsibilities

Build and run the campaign plan (budget, calendar, metrics).

Stand up field: volunteer pipeline, canvass/phone banks, GOTV windows; keep data clean.

Staff the team (comms, digital, field leads) and run daily stand‑ups / weekly retros.

Vendor wrangling (print, signs, digital buys) and timeline.

Risk & ops: debate logistics, event advance, scheduler, travel, room & board.

Partner with CFO on spend tracking; no surprises.

Endgame: GOTV execution and post‑E‑Day close‑out.

Communications Lead — core responsibilities

Build the message house (3–5 pillars, proof points, issue one‑pagers).

Press: media list, pitch, earned media, statements, embargoes.

Content: content calendar across site/email/social; approvals; voice consistency.

Rapid response: monitor, draft, and clear within minutes on hot issues.

Candidate prep: briefing notes, debate prep, Q&A trees, talk tracks.

Crisis playbook and escalation tree.

Separation of duties (clean lines)

CFO = compliance, reporting, receipts.

Campaign Manager = operations and delivery.

Comms Lead = message and media.
(They talk daily, but each owns their lane.)
