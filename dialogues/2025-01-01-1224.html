Alright. Let's not waste my time.

Show me the roadmap you've been working on. I want major milestones, I want dates, I want owners. Don't just give me fluffâ€”show me the work packages, what resources you're allocating, and which team members you have assigned. If you don't know the details, call your staff engineer over here so we can get the specifics right.

Hi friend, I don't really know where to start with this, I'm just trying to set up the project so we can have a strong foundation to build on. We've got a github pages site, sarahlacard.github.io, which we have setup with a non-jekyll mainly html project with a ps1 build script that triggers on github actions to build the pages from minimal .txt files. We've got another project ongoing, newyears25, as it's January 1st 2025 right now, a wednesday, but that project is going to need to be re-thought before we can make more progress on it. We also have various coding projects across devices, and don't have a good way of centralizing all the code into one place yet.

Alright, let me get this straight: Youâ€™ve got a GitHub Pages setup (sarahlacard.github.io) running a barebones HTML site, built by a PowerShell [ps1] script inside GitHub Actions from some .txt files. Youâ€™ve got this other half-baked project, newyears25, sitting around with no clear plan. And on top of that, youâ€™ve got code scattered all over multiple devices with zero centralization.

Hereâ€™s what you need to do, manager:

Unify Your Codebase
Quit messing with code across random devices. Use a single GitHub organization or a couple well-defined repositories. Either make a â€œmonorepoâ€ or create separate repos if that helps you break out logical components, but don't let it sprawl.

Establish a Build Workflow
That ps1 script for GitHub Pages is fine for now, but you need a consistent CI/CD approach. Write down the build steps, define how each project is tested, and get them all working automatically in GitHub Actions.

Roadmap the newyears25 Project
If youâ€™re already planning to re-think that project, do it properly. Stop half-assing it. Scope out the new functionality, set milestones, and assign owners who will deliver. Iâ€™m not going to keep hearing about it â€œneeding to be re-thoughtâ€ with no real plan.

Get me specifics. I want to see actual repos, build scripts, test coverage, and assigned dates. No more hand-waving. If your staff engineerâ€™s got the details, bring them in here so we can finalize the structure.

I'm not that interested with advice like "quit" - I can do these things, but not instantly. Each takes time and we must prioritize, don't be sending me off on hour or day longs tasks while we are still trying to get a baseline. We have the github.com/sarahlacard repo, eventually we'll move all the projects here and have as many of them public, but the sarahlacard.github.io site was important so that we can have an even simpler and more minimalistic version to keep everything together, it will eventually become a monorepo, maybe even housing collective stats/monitoring/dashboards for the various projects that we bring over.

I would like to start regularly creating apps that I can share with the public to improve my skills.

If you'd like to help me to establish a "build workflow" then we can certainly do that, but as far as documentation goes, we'd need to come up with a smart way to save that that makes sense as it relates to the rest of the project and projects.

And to jump past your meanness in point 3, I think the main changes that I want to make is to use a local db for user conversations and DPO pairs from the newyears25 project, but I think the front-end is mostly good. I was worried about trying to make the change to the data structure we are using on that project without breaking everything, but also if I want the data to be stored/logged locally to a machine, then I need a much better picture of networking and security before I do that. I only use mobile sim cards with 35-50gb of data a month, so I'm not sure what that does in terms of limiting my options.</pre>
